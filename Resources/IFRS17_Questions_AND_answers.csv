5,2.857142857,"An insurer enters into two separate contracts with the same policyholder at the same time.

According to IFRS 17, how should the insurer report these contracts?",Treat the contracts as a single arrangement because they achieve an overall commercial effect,Report both contracts separately as independent arrangements,Recognize only Contract A since it was issued first,Disclose both contracts but report them under IFRS 9,A,"When contracts are designed to achieve an overall commercial effect (such as one negating the obligations of another), IFRS 17 requires treating them as a single arrangement to reflect the economic substance."
6,2.857142857,"An insurer bundles multiple policies for a corporate client into a package with interdependent pricing. Some policies provide coverage, while others hedge specific risks associated with the insured entity. Under IFRS 17, how should these contracts be accounted for?",Each contract must be evaluated individually regardless of interdependencies,The bundled contracts should be treated as a single unit if they collectively achieve an overall commercial effect,Contracts should be separated since they have different durations,Each contract should be reported based on legal form rather than economic substance,B,IFRS 17 mandates that contracts designed to work together as a package with shared pricing or risk mitigation should be combined to reflect their true economic impact.

20,2.857142857,Which changes are excluded from adjusting the CSM?,Future service estimates,Time value updates,Risk of lapses,Policyholder behavior assumptions,B,Changes from the passage of time (interest accretion) affect finance income/expense rather than adjusting the CSM.
