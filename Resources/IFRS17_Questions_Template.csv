3,1,Which Balance Sheet entry item below is NOT expected to be shown by an insurer while implementing IFRS 17?,Insurance Contract Liabilities,Premium Receivables from Policyholders,Reinsurance Contract Assets,Insurance Contract Assets,B,"Under IFRS 17, many cash flows that used to appear as 'premium receivables' are incorporated into the measurement of the insurance contract asset or liability, rather than shown as a separate 'Premium Receivables from Policyholders' line."

What does this reserve represent?,Unpaid Claims,Unearned Profit,Earned Premium,Risk Adjustment,B,The CSM represents the unearned profit the insurer will recognise as it provides insurance coverage and services in future periods.

9,2,"If all the policyholders fully pay their premium on time, the 'Insurance Revenue' of a General Insurance Company can be compared to",Gross Written Premium,Gross Earned Premium,Net Earned Premium,New Written Premium,B,"When premiums are fully paid on time, the pattern of insurance revenue under IFRS 17 is broadly comparable to gross earned premium for the period."
10,2,IFRS17 has a new view on how reinsurance contracts should be treated. The spirit of the new approach is,Combine all reinsurance cashflows and policyholder cashflows to get a net position.,Separate all reinsurance cashflows from policyholder cashflows and report the net cost of reinsurance separately.,Combine only premium reinsurance cashflows and policyholder cashflows and separate claims cashflows.,Combine only claims reinsurance cashflows and policyholder cashflows and separate premium cashflows.,B,"IFRS 17 requires reinsurance contracts held to be accounted for separately from underlying contracts, highlighting the cost and effect of reinsurance rather than netting everything together."

The spirit of the new approach is,The insurer has the choice of discounting or not regardless of when the claim is expected to be paid,All claims expected to be paid after a year should be discounted and those expected to be paid in less than one year should also be discounted.,All claims expected to be paid after a year should be discounted and those expected to be paid in less than one year can be discounted or not depending on the choice of the insurer.,All claims must be discounted regardless of expected payment date.,C,"IFRS 17 requires discounting where the time value of money is significant (typically long-tail claims). For shorter-duration claims where the time value is not significant, discounting may not be required."
12,2,"Some people say adoption of IFRS 17 should be encouraged by regulators, such as National Insurance Commission (NIC), because it encourages CASH and CARRY by",Not considering Premium Receivables in the Balance Sheet,Ignoring Uncollected Premium in Income,It considers premium only if claims have been paid,It discounts claims,B,"IFRS 17 focuses revenue recognition on services provided and cash flows actually expected to be collected, reducing recognition of income from uncollected premiums—hence the 'cash and carry' notion."
13,2,"When an insurer discounts its liabilities at a higher rate than what it is expecting to earn, the National Insurance Commission (NIC) can easily detect this in the Profit & Loss Account by looking at",Insurance Revenue,Insurance Service Expenses,Net Financial Results,Insurance Service Results,C,A mismatch between discount rates applied to liabilities and the actual investment return will show up in the net financial result (combining finance income on assets and finance expense on insurance liabilities).
14,2,"Under the General Measurement Model (GMM), the insurance contract liabilities or assets are composed of",Liability for Remaining Coverage & Risk Adjustment Margin,Liability for Remaining Coverage & Liability for Incurred Claims,Contractual Service Margin & Liability for Incurred Claims,"Premium, Outstanding Claim Reserves and Incurred But Not Reported Reserves",B,"Under IFRS 17's GMM, the net position for insurance contracts is split between Liability for Remaining Coverage (LRC) and Liability for Incurred Claims (LIC), which together may form a net liability or asset."
